    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello! My name is Addy C. Acro-Santos, and welcome to parapups.us, the personal website of a professional loser dog!</p>

    <p>In reality I'm just a self-domesticated chimp with a particular affinity for anthropomorphic animals. In other words: I'm a furry. I'm also an Electrical Engineering major at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas who's spent most of their life within the confines of the Mojave Desert. I am a second-generation Filipino-American, which means I know what My interests include animation, trivia, technology, civics, and art. My pronouns are he/they, altho I do get a kick out of people thinking I'm a girl.</p>

    <p>This is where I dump my art and ideas, my own personal corner of the Internet, away from the walled gardens of social media networks. I'll write blogs about whatever tickles my fancy</p>

    <h1>About Addy</h1>
    <p>Addy is my fursona. He's a dog, specifically some kind of mutt and with some chihuahua and I think some dachshund in there? In any case, he's based on my real life dog, Lucky, who has the big ears and light brown fur but lacks the mane of black hair and proclivity for blue clothing. Like me, he is demi-bisexual and of an ambiguous gender. Also, his studies in Electrical Engineering have granted him lightning powers, because what's the point of being a furry if you can't have some fun?</p>
